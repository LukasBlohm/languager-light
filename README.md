# Languager-Light

## Overview

R-Shiny App to learn languages. Currently, it is centered around French, with translations to English and German.

## Features

The App currently consists of two modules:

1.  Explorer - Sample words or sentences and view their translations.
2.  Vocab - Test your vocabulary-knowledge by guessing randomly sampled or specific words.

## Live Demo

Check out the app on [Heroku](https://languager-00cfccf5e83f.herokuapp.com).

## Technical Details

This repo is based on [LukasBlohm/languager](https://github.com/LukasBlohm/languager/tree/main) which it uses as a git submodule. In contrast to languager, this is a more lightweight / restricted version. This makes it more handy to containerize the app and host it online.
